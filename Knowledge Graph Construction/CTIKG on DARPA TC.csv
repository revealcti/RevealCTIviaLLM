"Began attack with THEIA Ubuntu 12.04 x64 by exploiting Firefox 54.0.1 using a malicious ad server via
the www.gatech.edu website. The exploit resulted in the drakon implant running in memory in the
Firefox process with a connection out to the attacker operator console. The attacker used putfile to
write a drakon implant executable binary to the target host's disk. The attacker then executed the drakon implant from the target disk using a privilege escalated execution capability to run the new
process as root. The new root drakon implant process connected out to the operator console to give
the attacker a 2nd shell to the target host, this time with root access. The attacker closed the non-root
shell and switched over to the root shell. At this point the drakon implant stopped responding, and we
lost connection to the THEIA host (as well as the open connection to the TRACE host from earlier today).
The attacker gained access once again when Firefox browsed to www.gatech.edu. The attacker then
wrote another file to disk to be used later and left the connection to the operator console open.","[THEIA Ubuntu 12.04 x64, exploited, Firefox 54.0.1]

chance to pivot from the Firefox process to a new process. The exploit was repeated by once again
browsing to www.mit.gov.jo, and this time the attacker was able to remain on the system when Firefox
was closed. The attacker downloaded a libdrakon implant .so to the target file system and then

        I reviewed the long-term and short-term memories, and no modifications are needed based on the rules provided. The triples in the short-term memory are consistent with the long-term memory, and no new triples are added that don't exist in either memory. Therefore, the short-term memory remains unchanged.

"Continued attack against THEIA by exploiting the target via the malicious pass manager browser
extension in Firefox 54.0.1. The attacker had previously tried to load drakon into the memory of the
browser extension on Windows, but this was unsuccessful. So, the attacker resorted to writing the
drakon implant executable to disk on the target upon exploiting the browser extension. While noisier
than the originally planned attack, this achieved the same purpose. The attacker was able to run micro
apt from the target disk. Micro apt connected out to the micro C2 listener. The attacker then used
micro apt to perform a portscan of the known hosts on the target network.","[Attacker, exploited, target via malicious pass manager browser extension in Firefox 54.0.1]
